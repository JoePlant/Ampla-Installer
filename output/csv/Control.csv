For avoidance of doubt, you acknowledge that you must obtain a CAL for each simultaneous user of the SOFTWARE, whether such use takes place on a single computer at a single location or by a networked system such as Windows Terminal Server, Citrix, and ACP etc.  You may purchase additional CALs pursuant to this Licence, subject to receipt from SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC of a Quote for such rights and compliance by you with the terms of such Quote. The Quote will specify any reporting points for the SOFTWARE and you must only use the SOFTWARE for the number and type of reporting points specified in the Quote that you have purchased from SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC.\b\par
\b0 (b)\tab You may copy the SOFTWARE for backup purposes only in support of your permitted use of the SOFTWARE.\par
(c)\tab If you have received the SOFTWARE as a demonstration package, you may install and use the SOFTWARE on your computer for demonstration and evaluation purposes only for up to 60 days after such installation. \par
(d)\tab You may transfer the SOFTWARE from one computer to another, provided that you do not use the SOFTWARE on more than one computer at a time, in conjunction with the Licence Key.\par
(e)\tab You may only use the SOFTWARE for your internal business processes.\~ You may not use the SOFTWARE to perform services for any third party or permit a third party to use the SOFTWARE for its or its customers' benefit.\par

(b)\tab Updated versions of the SOFTWARE will be supplied and licensed subject to the terms of this Licence, as varied by SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC at the time of supply of any updated version.\par
(c)\tab Any reference to the SOFTWARE in this Licence will include any updated version provided to you by SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC or its distributors\par
\pard\keep\keepn\sb120\sa120\tx1134\b 3.\tab LICENCE KEY\par
